# **Maor Geter - User Management API**

**Recommendation:**

I recommend watching **Explanition.mov** for a clear walkthrough of the setup and how everything works. Itâ€™ll help you understand the system better.

I'm not able to upload it to GitHub due to file size limitations, but you can watch it here: [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x11J7CT0T9UEjLQmC-SCKmC-61O1TKOk/view?usp=sharing)

## **Overview**

This is a **Flask-based User Management Application** integrated with MongoDB, Prometheus, Grafana, and JWT authentication. The UI allows users to view the user list, but all modifications (create, update, delete) require authentication.

## **Features**

- **Flask Backend** - Chosen due to familiarity and prior experience, making development structured and efficient. Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework, well-suited for small applications with  **easy API handling** .

* **MongoDB** - Selected for its  **seamless integration with Flask and Python** , along with its flexibility as a NoSQL database. It allows dynamic schema modifications, making it  **adaptable for evolving application requirements** .
* **Prometheus & Grafana** - Prometheus  **collects real-time metrics** , while Grafana **visualizes performance data** with structured dashboards. This combination helps in  **monitoring API health and detecting issues quickly** .
* **Swagger UI** - A powerful API documentation tool that integrates well with Flask, making API  **testing and interaction more user-friendly** .
* **JWT Security** - Implements **authentication and authorization** to protect API endpoints. Only  **read operations (viewing users) are public** , while modifications (create, update, delete) require  **valid authentication** .

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/maorgeter/be.git

## Important Configuration Details

* **Admin Credentials**
  * In `app.py`, the admin credentials are  **hardcoded** :
    * **Email:** `maor@geter.com`
    * **Password:** `smartech`
  * These credentials are used to generate a **JWT token** for authentication.
* **MongoDB Connection**
  * The `database.py` file contains two MongoDB URIs for different environments:
    * **Docker Running:** `mongodb://mongo:27017`
    * **Local Running:** `mongodb://localhost:27017`
  * The application uses the correct  **URI based on the environment** .
* **Test Environment**
  * The `test_app.py` file is designed to run  **only in a local environment** .
  * Tests authenticate using the **hardcoded admin credentials** and interact with a local MongoDB instance.
  * **Ensure MongoDB is running locally before running tests.**
